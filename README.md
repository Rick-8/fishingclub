### Features left to impliment

 - I would love to add maps of the waters to aid in the allure of joinging the club and assist members in finding the right spot.
 - I would also like to add another page for a club shop, selling bait and tackle online, including new memberships with an online pay section.
 - and finally a sign in members area where members can sign in and and access their profile, Specific Venue details like gate codes and a booking section to regulate how many anglers can fish at one time, to protect the fish. Wich also has a news or updates section to keep members uptodate with club news.
