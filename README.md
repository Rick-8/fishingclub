### Features left to impliment

 - I would love to add maps of the waters to aid in the allure of joinging the club and assist members in finding the right spot.
 - I would also like to add another page for a club shop, selling bait and tackle online, including new memberships with an online pay section.
 - Finally a sign in members area where members can sign in and and access their profile, Specific Venue details like gate codes and a booking section to regulate how many anglers can fish at one time, to protect the fish. Wich also has a news or updates section to keep members uptodate with club news.

* HTML 
  - I ran the code through the checker and found 1 concern regarding the Phone number field on the Enquiries page, and some browsers might not support this functition.
  - The concern was addressed by placing * next to the name and email labels, and puting a key at the bottom.
  - I also reaserched the type="tel" on https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type_tel.asp which showed the following browsers that support it, and felt confident the risk was very low.

## Bugs
  - being my first ever page, there were a few bugs, and "opertunities to learn" along the way, which I spent time reaserching and spoke to tutor support for help and advice a could of times. but to name a couple,
  - getting the pics on the pictures page to fit toghter nicely was a challenge, but after speaking with a tutor and my mentor I discovered that the picture sizes were very big, and needed scaling down, which I was able to do easily using the windows paint function, and using flex-box got them lined up nicely.
